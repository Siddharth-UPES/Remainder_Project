## Code Overview

This application uses Python's **Streamlit** library for the user interface and the **threading** module to run the reminder check in the background. The **datetime** module is used to handle and compare time values. 

### Main Components:

1. **Reminder Input**: Users input a message and time for the reminder.
2. **Reminder Check**: The app checks the current time in a background thread and triggers reminders when the time matches.
3. **Clear All Reminders**: Users can clear all reminders with a click of a button.

### Background Thread:
A separate thread runs continuously in the background, checking the system's current time every 30 seconds. If the reminder time matches the current time, it triggers a notification and removes the reminder from the list.

## Example Use Case

1. **Set Reminder**: You enter "Meeting with John" as the message and "14:30" as the time.
2. **Notification**: When the clock strikes 14:30, a reminder will pop up saying "Meeting with John."
